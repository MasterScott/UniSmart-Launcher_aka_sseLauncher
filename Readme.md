### UniSmart Launcher / sseLauncher v1.2.0

*Universal configurable launcher* which adds some missing features to **syahmixp**'s **[SmartSteamEmu](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=62935)**. Make sure you place it in the same folder as the game's original *steam_api(64).dll*, next to *SmartSteamEmu* files!

------

***Features:***

- can automatically switch between running *SmartSteamEmu* through *loader* (`emuMethod = 1`) or *game executable* (`emuMethod = 2`)
- can run game executable and loader with *compatibility and/or administrator settings*
- can use *custom savegame folder for SmartSteamEmu*, when supported by game
- will backup/restore *last used steam id* and *unlocked achivements* to/from savegame folder
- will use the `appName` in *SSEOverlay*, instead of `appId` number

------

***Requirements:***

1. *SmartSteamEmu v1.3.9+* in the same folder as the game's original *steam_api(64).dll*
   - for easier access, when *steam_api(64).dll* is in a subfolder, you should use it with my latest **[UniGame Launcher](https://github.com/alex47exe/UniGame-Launcher/releases)**
   - when needed, make sure to use `..\` to specify correct paths to game executable and game folder
2. Cracked game executable if *SmartSteamEmu* doesn't work with the original one
